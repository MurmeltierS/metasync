# Product Sync Strategy Refactoring

## Overview

The `ProductSyncStrategy.js` file was refactored to reduce complexity and improve maintainability by:

1. Extracting specialized concerns into separate utility classes
2. Breaking down large methods into smaller, focused methods
3. Separating data processing from business logic
4. Implementing better patterns for tracking results

## New Utility Classes

The following utility classes were created to handle specific concerns:

### 1. ProductBatchProcessor (utils/ProductBatchProcessor.js)

Handles product batch fetching and pagination:
- Fetches products in batches with pagination support
- Handles product retrieval by handle
- Processes GraphQL responses to normalize the data structure

### 2. SyncResultTracker (utils/SyncResultTracker.js)

Manages tracking of operation results:
- Tracks creation, update, deletion, and failure counts
- Merges metafield statistics from various operations
- Provides summary logging and result formatting

### 3. MetafieldFilterUtils (utils/MetafieldFilterUtils.js)

Utility for metafield filtering operations:
- Filters metafields based on namespace and key constraints
- Handles special cases like 'all' namespace
- Supports various filtering patterns including namespace.key format

### 4. ProductMetafieldProcessor (utils/ProductMetafieldProcessor.js)

Processes metafields for products:
- Filters metafields using MetafieldFilterUtils
- Transforms reference metafields
- Logs detailed metafield processing information
- Syncs metafields to the target shop

### 5. ProductOperationHandler (utils/ProductOperationHandler.js)

Orchestrates product CRUD operations:
- Creates products with their associated data (variants, images, metafields)
- Updates products and their associated data
- Handles dry run logging
- Returns structured operation results

## Refactored ProductSyncStrategy

The ProductSyncStrategy class was simplified to:
- Initialize and coordinate utility classes
- Orchestrate the overall sync process
- Process products based on their existence and configured options
- Track and report overall results

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each class now has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Reduced File Size**: The strategy file is now much smaller (reduced from 1000+ lines to <250)
3. **Better Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Enhanced Reusability**: Utility classes can be used by other strategies
5. **Clearer Code Organization**: Functionality is grouped by purpose rather than mixed together

## Usage

To use the refactored code, no changes are necessary to external interfaces. The ProductSyncStrategy
class maintains the same constructor signature and public methods, ensuring backward compatibility.
